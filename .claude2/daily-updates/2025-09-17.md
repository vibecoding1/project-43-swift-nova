## Session 11:06 - Configured Remote-Only Development & Security
**Issues Solved:** Updated entire system for remote-only Supabase development and externalized all secrets per repo
**Changes Made:** 
- Modified all configs for remote-only Supabase (no local instance)
- Created environment-setup.md with strict security rules for Claude
- Updated CLAUDE.md, settings.json, architecture.md with security protocols
- Added multi-repo support with externalized secrets (Vercel, GitHub, Supabase)
**Future TODOs:** Test remote-only workflow, create .env.example template, verify security compliance

## Session 10:57 - Created Master CLAUDE.md Entry Point
**Issues Solved:** Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md as main entry point that Claude auto-loads on session start
**Changes Made:** 
- Built complete CLAUDE.md with tech stack overview, patterns, and session protocol
- Included React component and Edge Function code templates
- Added deployment workflows and command references
- Structured as master configuration that references .claude/ directory
**Future TODOs:** Test CLAUDE.md auto-loading in next session, create example components using patterns

- Updated settings.json with Edge Functions and Vercel deployment config
- Enhanced instructions.md with mandatory session start requirements
- Standardized architecture.md for full stack (Frontend→Vercel, API→Edge Functions)
- Updated coding-style.md with TypeScript and Edge Functions patterns
- Modified deploy.md for dual deployment (Vercel + Supabase CLI)
**Future TODOs:** Create example Edge Function, implement TypeScript setup, test deployment workflows

## Session 10:03 - Claude Directory Structure & Daily Updates System
**Issues Solved:** Created complete .claude/ directory structure with settings, commands, agents, and implemented daily update tracking system
**Changes Made:** 
- Created settings.json, coding-style.md, supabase-schema.md
- Added auto-fix.md, deploy.md, test-and-commit.md commands
- Built auto-fixer.md agent with AI-powered code analysis
- Implemented daily updates system in instructions.md
**Future TODOs:** Test daily update system in next session, create example React components following the coding standards
